== Compilation flags for DEBUG
When compiling the debug versions, the following flags were set:

  CFLAGS =-g -Wall
  LDFLAGS=-ljack -lsndfile


== Scripts
Two convenience scripts are provided to launch each showcase in gdb under the
supervision of jack_interposer.so. Open each script to see the commands.

== Jack Interposer
The jack interposer tool is needed for the interposer-showcase* scripts
to run. It is available here  https://github.com/raboof/jack_interposer
The scripts expect a shared object titled jack_interposer.so to be present
in the current directory in order to function correctly.
